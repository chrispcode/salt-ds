Icons are simplified visual representations of a specific action, object or concept. Country symbols represent a specific country and are used in contexts where geographical identification is necessary. 

The Salt design system has:
- 415 icons 
- 265 outline icons 
- 150 solid icons

## Icon variants

Icons come in two variant types: **Outline** and **Solid**. Please note that all icons within the icon set have an outline variant, but 115 don’t have a solid variant. 

### Solid icons

Solid icons are faster to recognise than outline icons due to less visual noise, especially depending on the complexity of the icon. Solid icons better represent how we view objects, whereas outline icons are silhouettes and therefore can take longer to perceive. 

### Outline icons

Outline icons have a lower emphasis on non-imperative items and are more recognisable when they have wider inner spacing. They’re also better to use when you need to make subtle design cues more noticeable.

## Country symbols

Country symbols can be considered icons that are visually representative of a country or inter-governmental organisation. All flags are available in both circle and rectangle shapes.
