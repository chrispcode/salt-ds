## What is a Salt theme

Salt theme is a collection of defined visual styles that shape the overall look-and-feel of a digital product. This encompasses elements like color, typography, spacing, and corner radius, ensuring a consistent and cohesive appearance throughout the product.

A theme in Salt enables delivery teams to streamline the process of creating a consistent design language across their business domain, platforms or products.

### Design tokens

Salt themes are defined by design tokens that are organized into 3 groups. Each group of tokens has a specific purpose:

1. **[Characteristics](/salt/themes/characteristic-tokens)**: Semantically grouped tokens that are used to style components.
2. **Palette**: Consolidated view of values used in Characteristic tokens â€“ the simplest entry point to modify the theme.
3. **Foundations**: Ramps of tokens for the raw values that underpin the design system.

**Example: Status Characteristic Token in Toast component**

Toast use status tokens to denote status with color, such as green for success.

- Characteristic Token: `--salt-status-success-foreground-decorative`
- Palette Token: `--salt-palette-success-foreground`
- Foundation Token: `--salt-color-green-400` (default: `rgb(48, 156, 90)`)

To keep tokens manageable, Salt doesn't create tokens for every style attribute of a component. Instead, Salt provides tokens that reflect component design decisions. This means we can maintain the quality of interaction design patterns and accessibility.

## Supported themes

As of Q3 2024, Salt offers two themes: the current theme, that reflects the UI Toolkit (UITK) design language, and the new J.P. Morgan (JPM) brand-endorsed [Salt Next theme](./salt-next-theme).

In Salt's architecture, theme styles (known as 'design tokens') are kept separate from components. Regardless of the chosen theme (the look-and-feel), the underlying components remain the same. This separation makes it easy to switch between themes, without breaking or altering the underlying application build.
