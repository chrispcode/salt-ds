<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Chrome">

## Chrome

Button has two chrome colors: `accent` and `neutral`. Accent buttons will reflect the primary color of the design language.

### Best practices

- Use accent buttons for the main calls-to-action in your application workflows (button bars, card actions, promotional banners, etc.).
- Use neutral buttons for secondary tasks or workflows, such as configuring settings in preferences, or actions embedded in form fields and forms. Neutral buttons can also be used to give greater prominence to alternative actions alongside accent buttons.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Appearance">

## Appearance

Button comes in three variants based on appearance—`filled`, `outlined` and `minimal`—which give button more or less visual prominence on the page.

### Best practices

First choose the button `chrome` that best fits your use case and then pick the `appearance` that offers the right level of visual prominence.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="IconAndText">

## Icon and text

Add an icon before the text to reinforce the button text. Add an icon after the button text to suggest movement or a direction.

### Best practices

- Place an icon to the left of the text to further describe the action, such as “search” or “download”. Additional description can make it easier for users to locate actions.
- Place an icon to the right of the text to suggest direction or movement, such as opening a menu overlay or expanding a panel. When the user activates the button, there's typically an immediate visual change.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="IconOnly">

## Icon only

Display an icon-only button with no text when you have limited on-screen space, and users can easily understand the icon.

### Best practices

- An icon-only button should be self-explanatory, ideally using well-known symbols. If the button's purpose isn’t clear from the icon alone, add a text description.
- Use [`Tooltip`](../tooltip) on an icon-only button to describe the action, such as “Send comment”, “Search documents”, or “Open settings”.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Disabled" >

## Disabled

Use the disabled state for a button that the user can’t press.

To set the button as disabled pass the prop `disabled={true}`.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="FocusableWhenDisabled" >

## Focusable when disabled

If a disabled element can be enabled (either by the user or by the system), it should be focusable. To allows this you can pass `focusableWhenDisabled={true}`.

This is useful when you want to show a tooltip or a popover when the user hovers over the button.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="FullWidth" >

## Full width

Use full width buttons on mobile devices or smaller viewports, the button will take up the full width of its container.

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="CTA" displayName="CTA - Deprecated" >

## CTA - Deprecated

_Note:_ The `variant` prop is deprecated. Use `appearance="filled"` and `chrome="accent"` instead.

Use the CTA button for high-priority actions. For example, a CTA button may prompt a user to register, sign up, submit or buy.

### Best practices

Use CTA buttons sparingly. They represent the default or expected action on the page.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Primary" displayName="Primary - Deprecated" >

## Primary - Deprecated

_Note:_ The `variant` prop is deprecated. Use `appearance="filled"` and `chrome="neutral"` instead.

This is the default variant. Use the primary button for routine, nonurgent actions, for example, to move to the next page or complete a task.

</LivePreview>

<LivePreview componentName="button" exampleName="Secondary" displayName="Secondary - Deprecated" >

## Secondary - Deprecated

_Note:_ The `variant` prop is deprecated. Use `appearance="minimal"` and `chrome="neutral"` instead.

Use the secondary button for noncritical actions that support the user but don't impact a flow. They're typically the alternative option available alongside a primary action. For example, a secondary “back” button may support a primary “next” button.
