## Single date selection

An uncontrolled `DatePicker`, composed of a `DateInput` and a `Calendar` component, allows users to select a single date when the `selectionVariant` prop is set to "single", without requiring explicit state management in the parent component, making it ideal for simple date selection tasks.

## Single date selection with min/max date

To constrain the selected date within a specific range, use the `minDate` and/or `maxDate` props. If `minDate` is not provided, it defaults to the year 1900. If `maxDate` is undefined, it defaults to the year 2100. This ensures that the selected date remains within the specified range.
