Salt offers many [components](/salt/components) and [patterns](/salt/patterns) you can use and build on top of. There will still be times where you want to build a custom component to suit specific product need. We will walk through what to consider and what is available for you to reuse.

## Design to be reusable

A good component should be reusable across multiple places. When building on top of Salt, it would be ideal if your component can be used across all [styling options](/salt/theming/index#styling-options) just like Salt components. To achieve that, you will need to use the right [design tokens](/salt/theming/index#design-tokens).

### Color tokens

Instead of using hex or RGB values of color, [characteristics tokens](/salt/theming/accordionview) are designed with semantic meanings and to adapt application's [accent or mode](/salt/theming/index#accent--mode) settings through palette tokens.

Here are some example tokens for you to take a look first:

- `--salt-container-primary-background` is a good starting point for most background, which will switch nicely between light and dark mode with the right color. It is used by container components like [Panel](/salt/components/panel) and [Card](/salt/components/card).
- `--salt-content-primary-foreground` is the [default color](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/salt-ds/blob/e76e5b92dcb6cfae02813137098393b91f54e501/packages/theme/css/global.css#L6) for text and icons.
- `--salt-status-info-foreground-informative` represents informational status. The `informative` suffix indicates it will meet minimal contrast ratio when used against Salt container background colors (oppose to `decorative`).
- `--salt-accent-borderColor` can be used for border color (notice `borderColor` naming convension), which will reflect accent styling option choice â€“ teal or blue.

### Size and spacing tokens

Instead of using fixed pixel values, Salt [size](/salt/foundations/size) and [spacing](/salt/foundations/spacing) foundation tokens will adapt to [density](/salt/foundations/density) option.

For example, `--salt-spacing-100` scales from 4px in high density to 16px in low density. Similarly, `--salt-size-base` scales from 20px in high density to 44px in touch density. Combining both results the height defination for [app header](/salt/patterns/app-header) pattern, which would work across all densities.

## Salt examples

Good practices shown above are being used across Salt components and patterns. You may find it helpful to study how tokens are used by Salt.

- [Button](/salt/components/button) uses actionable characteritics, size token for height and spacing token for inline padding.
