Salt offers many [components](/salt/components) and [patterns](/salt/patterns) you can use and build on top of. There will still be times where you may want to build a custom component to suit your specific product need. We will walk you through what to consider and what is available for you to build on top of.

## Design to be reusable

A good component should be reusable across multiple places. When building on top of Salt, it would be ideal if your component can be used across all [styling options](/salt/theming/index#styling-options) just like Salt ones. To achieve that, you will need to pick the right [design token](/salt/theming/index#design-tokens) to use.

### Color variables

It would be great for your component to adapt to application's [accent or mode](/salt/theming/index#accent--mode) setting, and [characteristics tokens](/salt/theming/accordionview) are designed to be used for this with semantic meanings.  

Here are some example tokens for you to take a look first:

- `--salt-container-primary-background` is a good starting point for "background", which will switch nicely between light and dark mode. It is used by container components like [Panel](/salt/components/panel) and [Card](/salt/components/card).
- `--salt-content-primary-foreground` is the [default "foreground" color](https://github.com/jpmorganchase/salt-ds/blob/e76e5b92dcb6cfae02813137098393b91f54e501/packages/theme/css/global.css#L6) for text and icons.
- `--salt-status-info-foreground-informative` represents informational status. The "informative" suffix indicates it will meet minimal contrast ratio when used against Salt container background colors (oppose to "decorative").
